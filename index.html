                                What prevents people from making good decisions?
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                           <p>
                         Uncertainty plays a major role and is driven by hidden information and luck.      
                </p>    

                        <p>
                        We are built for tribes and often don't trust information from outside our tribe.       
                </p>    
                                <p>
                        We are not built for disconfirming the things we already believe in.        
                </p>    
               
                     <p>
                                       Put the above together and things can really fall apart.

     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">"Motivated reasoning" is a key problem!</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Video below provides a great explanation of how we process / challenge info depending on whether it agrees with us or not.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Tribes give you a sense of belonging and distinctiveness (but also superiority...?)</li>
      <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Tribe is telling you what is true and trustworthy. </li>
      <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Beware of echo chambers! Danger is that even if you get great information from outside, it will be dismissed due to tribal problem and bias</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">How to avoid? Universalism. Whether it is Mussilini or your mom telling you the earth is round, it is still true!!! </li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Imagine information absent of the source. OR, imagine it being delivered from a source that you trust.</li>

                                Thinking of decisions as bets
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                   <ul class="arr">
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">How does your thinking change if you think of something as a bet?</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">You retreat from a place of certainty to a place of probabilistic thinking.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Kind of questions you ask are now very different.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">What would people with counterviews say about this?</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">We don’t have perfect information and the future is always uncertain.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Thinking like this makes one more open minded to why one might be wrong and makes you information hungry.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">It also helps to refine beliefs and predictions.</li>

                                Skill vs luck and self narritives...
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                   <ul class="arr">
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Skill vs luck – the self serving bias is very strong. If <i>I</i> screw up vs if <i>you</i> screw up: the stories are different...</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Form a good decision group with different values.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">We don’t like a negative update to our self image…</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Coaching example from a poker coach - are you just complaining or do you want to learn?</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Reasoning to be accurate vs reasoning to be right.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Who wins in a bet – the person who is reasoning to be right or reasoning to be accurate?</li>  
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Thinking of decisions as bets takes you from the <strong><i>right</i></strong> mode to the <strong><i>accurate</i></strong> mode</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Three ideas to put in a group charter:</li>
                     <ul>
                            <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Focus and commitment to accuracy</li>
                             <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Hold each other accountable</li>
                             <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Be open to diverse viewpoints</li>
                     </ul>

     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">	Now one can process information differently, not through “luck vs smart” lense, but looking for mistakes/learnings/curiousity.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Also, what happens is that you get rewarded for saying “I think I made a mistake” and the learnings that happen from it.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Also, the effect this has on the tribal dynamic is interesting. Is your tribe interested in learning/improving or in moaning?</li>

     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Everything can be quantified...</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Thinking in ranges.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Great example of testing beliefs in vid below.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Can start with 20 – 80%, then refine from there.</li>

                               Key takeaways
                <p>&nbsp</p>
               <ol>
                 
        
      <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Think about the framing of our beliefs/decisions – from defending to the hilt to seeing it as provisional and subject to upgrade/improvement.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Following from above, think of decisions as bets. Be information hungry / curious / seek counter views in order to be more accurate. From being right to being more accurate.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Accept that evolution gets in our way and that even being armed with the information does not solve the problem. We need help and this means input / perspectives / challenge from others.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Being honest and open about uncertainty creates the space for others to open up and share their views. </li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Keep a focus on moving ahead from where you are – complaining is not helpful. Rather focus on seeking input / perspective / trying a different strategy.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Be particularly mindful about “motivated reasoning” and how that gets amplified through the tribe effect. Consider how the group agrees to mitigate against this.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Experiment with other techniques to improve decisions. For example deconstructing a decision beforehand, back-casting and pre-mortems</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Always see maintaining the status quo as a decision in own right.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Be compassionate with yourself and others. This is always a work in progress, getting it wrong a little less or catching yourself sooner makes a huge difference.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Know thyself – make Ulysses contracts for situations where you know you may experience specific challenges.</li>
     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">	Teams must challenge themselves to prevent / reduce “echo chamber” risk (ie just repeating the views the group all agrees are the truth).</li>
                     <li  style = "line-height:1.3;">Even on hard to quantify decisions / beliefs, take a stab at a range and refine from there – this a healthy dynamic.</li>
                              
                </ol>
